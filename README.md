# Twitter Bot: Stream Responder 
This Twitter bot looks for Twitter mentions with a key phrase from a certain list of key phrases and will automatically respond with the appropriate response. It will either link the stream or provide the streaming schedule.

This is a simple bot that I made primarily to learn how the Twitter API works and how to work with the Python Tweepy library.

### Current Key Phrases:
'stream link' - will link the stream,

'stream schedule' - will provide stream schedule,

'stream time' - will provide stream schedule,

'stream when' - will provide stream schedule,

'when do you stream' - will provide stream schedule,

'when are you streaming' - will provide stream schedule
